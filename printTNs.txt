Write a short portable and easy to read C program that would read strings of TEL URI and SIP URI values both from a file (sip_tel_list.txt) and stdin (can use the same file to send to stdin) to derive and print out
TN (telephone number), TON (type of number), NPI (Numbering plan identificator) for each line according to the rules below.
The program needs to be compiled without warnings and output provided for review.

For example:
TN: 19736194383		TON: 2		NPI: 1
TN: 5212291533253	TON: 1		NPI: 1
...


The TN digits in a TEL URI or SIP URI may be determined as follows:  
If the value is in TEL URI format, then the digits may be found in the telephone-subscriber portion of the TEL URI as defined in RFC 3966.  
Typically, the digits are found after the "tel:" and prior to any ";".  
If the value is in SIP URI format, then the digits may be found in the user portion of the SIP URI as defined in RFC 3261.  
Typically, when the user portion is given as a telephone number (e.g. user=phone), the digits are found after the "sip:" and prior to any ":", ";", or "@".  
Dashes may be found within the digits in either format.  
Additional visual separators may also be found within the digits, including ".", "(", and ")".
Visual separators need to be removed before the TN is printed out.
Telephone numbers (TNs) can have certain dialing prefixes like "*67", "*82" or "*272" than need to be removed before printing.

TNs in the lines that start with "tel:" or have "user=phone", should always set NPI=1;
For TNs that start with "+" or "011", remove these characters from printed TN, and set TON=1 if NPI==1 based on the rule above, otherwise TON=0;
For any lines that have "user=phone", set NPI=1, otherwise NPI=0;
For any lines that have "user=phone", but TNs do not start with "+" or "011", and TN is more than 7 digits long, after extra characters are removed, set TON=2;
Any TN that is 7 digits or less long after extra characters are removed, should have TON=3.

Here is what the possible values for TON and NPI mean:

TON (Type Of Number)

        0: Unknown
        1: International
        2: National
        3: Network Specific
        4: Subscriber Number
        5: Alphanumeric
        6: Abbreviated

NPI (Numbering Plan Identificator)

        Unknown = 0
        ISDN/telephone numbering plan (E163/E164) = 1
        Data numbering plan (X.121) = 3
        Telex numbering plan (F.69) = 4
        Land Mobile (E.212) =6
        National numbering plan = 8
        Private numbering plan = 9
        ERMES numbering plan (ETSI DE/PS 3 01-3) = 10
        Internet (IP) = 13
        WAP Client Id (to be defined by WAP Forum) = 18
